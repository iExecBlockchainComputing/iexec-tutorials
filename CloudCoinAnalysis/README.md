# CloudCoinAnalysis


Analysis of the 3 main cryptocurrencies offering a cloud computing solution:  GOLEM, SONM, IEXEC and Bitcoin.    

The application runs on top of iExec platform and generate a market report, it performs exploratory data analysis, generating graphes, and use a machine learning algorithm to predict the market prices in future 30 days for the 3 cryptocurrencies and also Bitcoin.

## Data and algorithm source:

The code is forked from:

* https://github.com/jieyima/Cryptocurrency_Investment_Analysis_and_Modeling for the application
* https://github.com/JesseVent/crypto to build the datasets


## Create and store datasets on your data wallet

The Crypto R package helps to download historical Cryptocurrency Prices using the CoinMarketCap API

### Generate the dataset file

The getcloudcoin.R script generates the csv dataset file, containing the full history for BTC, GNT, SNM and RLC cryptos.

```
 Rscript getcloudcoin.R
```
The script creates locally a cloudcoin_YYYY-MM-DD.csv file.
Then generate the zip file and place it in the dataset repo.
```
zip dataset/cloudcoin_2019-10-29.zip cloudcoin_2019-10-29.csv
 adding: cloudcoin_2019-10-29.csv (deflated 67%)
```

## Installing iExec

Follow instructions to install the SDK and set up your wallet  
https://docs.iex.ec/quickstart.html
and
https://docs.iex.ec/wallet.html

In this demo, 2 wallets have been generated one for for the app developer and one for the data owner: **developer_wallet** and **data_owner_wallet**.      
The sdk options **--wallet_file=** will be used to select the good owner for all commands.
For convenience, you can use your own wallet for both, app and dataset.

### Register the dataset on the blockchain

Let's register the dataset, the dataset is not store on the blockchain ethereum, the blockchain is only use to manage the data ownership, access and monetization.

```
iexec dataset init --wallet-file data_owner_wallet
```
Edit the dataset info in iexec.json file.

The dataset file must have a public access on the web, the dataset has to be accessible from any machines.  

The checksum will be use to check the integrity on the file. The dev is in progress, no need to fill in the checksum for the moment.

```
"dataset": {
  "owner": "0x9CdDC59c3782828724f55DD4AB4920d98aA88418",
  "name": "cloincoin-dataset-20191029",
  "multiaddr": "https://raw.githubusercontent.com/iExecBlockchainComputing/apps/master/CloudCoinAnalysis/dataset/cloudcoin_2019-10-29.zip",
  "checksum": "0x0000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000"
}
```
The dataset is store in github, use the raw prefix to define the file path.
In this example, the git link
```
https://github.com/iExecBlockchainComputing/iexec-tutorials/blob/master/CloudCoinAnalysis/dataset/cloudcoin_2019-10-29.zip
```
has to be replaced by
```
https://raw.githubusercontent.com/iExecBlockchainComputing/apps/master/CloudCoinAnalysis/dataset/cloudcoin_2019-10-29.zip
```

Deploy the dataset with the iExec SDK

```
iexec dataset deploy --wallet-file data_owner_wallet

✔ Deployed new dataset at address 0x9D1C683E607FdE13C76fb248B08E916cd0C55862
```

### Publish selling order for the dataset.

As the dataset is now registered and the ownership is stored on the blockchain; the owner has to publish order defining the price, the volume and restrictions for the usage of the dataset.

```
iexec order init --dataset --wallet-file data_owner_walletℹ using chain [kovan]
✔ Saved default datasetorder in "iexec.json", you can edit it:
dataset:            0x9D1C683E607FdE13C76fb248B08E916cd0C55862

requesterrestrict:  0x0000000000000000000000000000000000000000

```

Let's create an order with 10 nRLC cost and a volume of 1000 tasks with no extra restriction, regarding the application or a workerpool or any end-users.
The dataset created should be extensively used.   

Edit the iexec.json file.

```
"datasetorder": {
  "dataset": "0x9D1C683E607FdE13C76fb248B08E916cd0C55862",
  "datasetprice": 10,

  "requesterrestrict": "0x0000000000000000000000000000000000000000"
}
```

Now the dataset is deployed and we published dataset order, without restriction, so anyone can use my dataset with an app with the pay per use model. You note that is not sustainable and safe model because anynone should copy the dataset. We'll come back later on this point.      

## Deploy the application

The application is already dockerized and it can process all datasets created with the R script, the data are daily updated.

The application is available at
https://hub.docker.com/r/iexechub/cloudcoin

Source code in the current repository: Dockerfile, cloudcoin.py and entrypoint.sh

### Register applications on the blockchain

The registration is similar to the dataset registration.
First, we will register the application and then publish orders with defining a price, a volume and restrictions.

```
iexec app init
```

Edit iexec.json file, and set up the name, the address and the hash of the docker image
"checksum" is the docker image checksum, obtained with a docker pull command, the hexadecimal number after "digest: sha256:"

```
docker pull registry.hub.docker.com/iexechub/cloudcoin
Using default tag: latest
latest: Pulling from iexechub/cloudcoin
Digest: sha256:5496bd85e2b787b3a84dc7fb53e4d2c952f9eab13419e0f496be7eeefcc66bd6
Status: Image is up to date for registry.hub.docker.com/iexechub/cloudcoin:latest
```
Do not forget to add a "0x" prefix to the hash.

```

### Test locally the app with dataset

```
rm -rf iexec_in iexec_out
mkdir iexec_in iexec_out;

```

### Encrypt the dataset to secure your dataset usage:


The data registration workflow is similar.
Note, in real case, you should also white listing of application on trusted workerpool.  

```
iexec dataset init --encrypted

✔ Saved default dataset in "iexec.json", you can edit it:

```
Copy the dataset in .datasets/original/

```
cp dataset/cloudcoin_2019-10-29.zip datasets/original/
```

Encrypt the dataset
```
iexec dataset encrypt
ℹ Using default encryption aes-256-cbc

ℹ Generated encrypted file for cloudcoin_2019-10-29.zip in /home/eric/apps/CloudCoinAnalysis/datasets/encrypted/cloudcoin_2019-10-29.zip.enc
✔ Encrypted datasets stored in "/home/eric/apps/CloudCoinAnalysis/datasets/encrypted", you can publish the encrypted files.
Datasets keys stored in "/home/eric/apps/CloudCoinAnalysis/.secrets/datasets", make sure to backup them.
Once you deploy an encrypted dataset run "iexec dataset push-secret [datasetAddress]" to securely share the dataset key with the workers.

```

It produces the secret key for decrypting the dataset

```
    cat ./.secrets/dataset/myAwsomeDataset.file.secret
```
and the encrypted dataset, you must share at a public url

Go back to the normal workflow: dataset registration and order publication
